Our Products / Services
Hercules Innovations is uniquely positioned to capitalise on a significant market opportunity in New Zealand and beyond.
The increasing complexity of business operations and the rapid pace of technological advancements have created a pressing
need for comprehensive, integrated solutions that address both strategic and technical challenges. Our suite of services,
which includes Business Advisory, Project Management, IT Solutions Development, IT Consultation and Advisory, and
Outsource IT Team Management, is designed to meet this demand. By offering tailored solutions that are customised to the
specific needs of each client, we can provide exceptional value and help businesses navigate their unique challenges
effectively. This holistic approach ensures that our clients receive not only strategic guidance but also the technical support
necessary to implement and sustain their business improvements.
The market segments we are targeting, including small to mid-sized businesses and tech startups, are particularly well-suited
to benefit from our services. These businesses often face resource constraints and require scalable, cost-effective solutions
to remain competitive. Hercules Innovations addresses these needs by offering end-to-end project management, specialised
IT training, and the management of third-party outsourcing teams. This allows our clients to focus on their core business
activities while we handle the complexities of project execution and technical support. Additionally, our commitment to
staying at the forefront of technology ensures that our clients are always equipped with the latest tools and strategies,
enabling them to maintain a competitive edge in an ever-evolving business landscape. By establishing long-term advisory
relationships, we aim to become a trusted partner, providing continuous support and driving ongoing improvements in our
clients' operations.

Hercules Innovations is poised for significant growth and profitability, as evidenced by our financial projections. In the initial
years, the company will experience a period of investment and development, with a net loss of $27,263 in FY2024 and $106,220
in FY2025. However, as our services gain traction and our client base expands, we anticipate a substantial increase in income,
reaching $150,000 in FY2026 and $450,000 by FY2028. This growth trajectory is supported by our diverse service offerings,
including business consultations, project management, IT consultations, and tailored IT solutions, which are in high demand
in the New Zealand market. By FY2028, we project a net profit of $118,440, demonstrating the viability and potential of our
business model.
Our cash flow projections further underscore the financial health and sustainability of Hercules Innovations. Starting with a
robust bank position of $200,000, we will navigate through the initial years of negative cash flow, driven by strategic
investments in staffing and operational expenses. By FY2027, we expect to achieve positive net cash from operations,
amounting to $43,440, and this upward trend will continue, culminating in a closing bank position of $290,722 by FY2028-29.
This positive cash flow will enable us to reinvest in the business, enhance our service offerings, and ensure long-term
stability. The financial projections clearly indicate that Hercules Innovations is well-positioned to become a leading player in
the business management and IT consulting sectors in New Zealand.
